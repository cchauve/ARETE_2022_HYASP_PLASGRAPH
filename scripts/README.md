### <a href="https://cchauve.github.io/">Cedric Chauve</a>, Simon Fraser University

This repo contains miscaellenous scripts:
- `eval_plasgraph.py` generates the figures illustrating the accuracy of plASgraph;
- `evaluate_sample.py` and `plot_statistics.py` generate the statistics and figures to evaluate the accuracy of HyAsP;
- `filter_hyasp_questionable_plasmids.[py,sh]` are used to extract the putative plasmids bins generated by HyAsP;
- `[hyasp,plasgraph]_install.sh` install both tools.
