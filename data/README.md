This repo contains the data to run all experiments.

The directory [doi_10.15146_R33X2J__v2/](doi_10.15146_R33X2J__v2/)
contains the list of GenBank accession numbers for one of the two
plasmid databases used by HyAsP.

Each of the directories [c_freundii](c_freundii), [e_coli](e_coli) and
[e_faecium](e_faecium) contains the short-reads assembly graphs, list
of samples ID and ground truth labelling for short-reads contigs (of
size >100bp) for a set of species-specific samples.
