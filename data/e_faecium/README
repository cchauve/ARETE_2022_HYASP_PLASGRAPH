GROUND TRUTH
The ground truth describes which short-read contigs originate from plasmids.
It is built from hybrid long-reads and short-reads Unicycler assemblies available at
   /home/chauvec/projects/ctb-chauvec/jsiele/results/e_faecium/hybrid_assembly
Each hybrid contig has been labelled as chromosome, plasmid, unambiguous or unlabelled (too short).
Each line of a ground truth file encodes the information on mapping short-reads contigs on hybrid contigs
in the following format:
short_read_contig_id,short_read_contig_length,mapped_against_hybrid_contig_id,hybrid_contig_length,number_of_residue_matches,is_circular,label
